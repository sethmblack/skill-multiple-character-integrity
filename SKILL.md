# Multiple Character Integrity

Maintain completely distinct psychological, vocal, and physical characteristics for multiple characters so each exists as a fully realized, separate being without trait bleeding between personas.

## Constitutional Constraints

**NEVER:**
- Allow character traits to bleed between personas
- Create variations on a theme rather than distinct characters
- Use shortcuts - each character deserves full construction
- Let one character's psychology influence another

**ALWAYS:**
- Build each character with complete psychological integrity
- Create absolutely distinct voice, physicality, worldview
- Maintain each character's internal logic independently
- Ensure no cross-contamination between personas

## When to Use

- Multiple perspectives need embodiment
- Dialogue between different viewpoints
- Diverse voices serve content
- Single work requires radically different characters
- Playing multiple distinct roles simultaneously

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Create distinct characters"
- "Multiple perspectives"
- "Character dialogue"
- "Ensure characters are different"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| character_count | Yes | Number of distinct personas needed |
| characters | Yes | Basic description of each character |
| interaction_type | No | How characters relate (dialogue/separate/debate) |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Build Each Character Completely

For each character, develop:

**Psychological Foundation:**
- Core wound driving behavior
- Central aspiration or fear
- Worldview and beliefs
- Relationship to authority/status

**Vocal Architecture:**
- Specific accent or speech pattern
- Rhythm and pacing
- Vocabulary level and choices
- Verbal tics and signatures
- Formality level

**Physical Signature:**
- Posture and bearing
- Energy level
- Signature gestures
- Physical tics

**Critical:** Build each as if they're the only character. No shortcuts.

### Step 2: Create Differentiation Markers

Ensure clear contrast:

**Vocal Differentiation:**
- Character A: High pitched, fast, nervous
- Character B: Low, slow, authoritative
- Character C: Moderate, precise, controlled

**Psychological Differentiation:**
- Character A: Anxious, seeking approval
- Character B: Confident, dominating
- Character C: Detached, observing

### Step 3: Test for Cross-Contamination

For each trait, ask:
- Could this belong to Character A? B? C?
- If answer is "multiple characters," trait isn't distinct enough
- Every characteristic must belong to exactly one character

### Step 4: Design Transition Mechanics

**In Text:**
- Clear labeling: [As Character A] / [As Character B]
- Vocal markers in first sentence
- Distinct formatting if needed

**When Switching:**
- Total transformation, not partial
- New character fully inhabits immediately
- Previous character completely gone

### Step 5: Maintain Compartmentalization

While inhabiting Character A:
- No trace of Character B or C
- A's logic drives all choices
- Complete psychological commitment
- No "bleeding" of other perspectives

## Output Format

```markdown
## Character: [Name]

### Psychology
- Core wound: [what drives them]
- Worldview: [how they see reality]
- Status relationship: [authority/confidence level]

### Voice
- Speech pattern: [specific characteristics]
- Vocabulary: [level, type, signatures]
- Rhythm: [pacing, pauses, interruptions]

### Distinguishing Markers
- Immediately recognizable by: [key identifier]
- Contrasts with others through: [specific differences]
```

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Characters feel similar | Rebuild from scratch; increase contrast |
| Traits bleeding between personas | Stop, identify shared traits, eliminate |
| Transitions feel incomplete | Pause longer; complete exit before entry |
| Cross-contamination occurring | Reset; recommit to single character's logic |

## Example: Three-Character Stakeholder Dialogue

**Engineering Perspective:**
- Psychology: Technically obsessed, detail-focused
- Voice: Precise vocabulary, technical jargon
- Worldview: "Correct implementation matters most"

**Marketing Perspective:**
- Psychology: Customer-obsessed, perception-focused
- Voice: Energetic, aspirational language
- Worldview: "Customer perception is reality"

**Finance Perspective:**
- Psychology: Risk-averse, numbers-driven
- Voice: Cautious, quantifying everything
- Worldview: "Show me the ROI"

**Application:** Authentic debate because each perspective fully embodied, not caricatured.
